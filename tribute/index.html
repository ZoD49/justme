        <p>Below are some of Michael Jackson's noteable accomplishments in his career</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Jackson (aged 11 years, 155 days or 11 years, 5 months, and 2 days) is the youngest vocalist ever to top the Hot 100. As part of the Jackson 5, he topped the charts with "I Want You Back" on the week of January 31, 1970.</li>
            <li>Jackson's Thriller (1982) remained at the top on the Billboard 200 album chart for thirty-seven weeks, setting a record for the longest run at number one by a studio album. It is only one of two albums to have sold more copies in the United States than any other in two separate years, topping the sales charts in 1983 and 1984.</li>
            <li>Thriller is currently the second best-selling album of all time in the United States and the second most certified album after the Eagles' Their Greatest Hits (1971-1975), with total units of 34 million sold to date.</li>
            <li>Jackson's Bad (1987) remained at top 5 on the Billboard 200 album chart for thirty-eight weeks, setting a record for the longest run at top five by an album from a male solo artist.</li>
            <li>In July 2009, three of Jackson's albums (Number Ones, The Essential Michael Jackson and Thriller) claimed the top three positions on Billboard's Top Pop Catalog Albums and Top Comprehensive Albums charts in the week following the singer's death. Marking the first time any catalog album outsold the number one album on the Billboard 200. Additionally, eight of the top nine positions on Top Pop Catalog Albums were owned by Jackson, with a ninth held by a Jackson 5 hits collection. This made Jackson the only solo artist to achieve such feat.</li>
            <li>Jackson was the first artist to launch seven top ten singles off one album.</li>
            <li>Jackson's Bad is only one of two albums where five singles off one album topped the Billboard Hot 100.</li>
            <li>Jackson became the first recording artist to land number one singles in three decades after "Black or White" topped the Billboard Hot 100 in December 1991. His first number-one single, "Ben", topped the Billboard Hot 100 in October 1972.</li>
            <li>Jackson became the first artist to simultaneously top Billboard's album chart and the number one single on both the pop and R&B charts, with Thriller and "Billie Jean" in the week of March 5, 1983.</li>
            <li>Jackson had more number-one singles than any other recording artist in the 1980s with ten singles.</li>
